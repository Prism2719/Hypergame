# Hypergame

### Rules

- Never commit on Main branch until code is reviewed
- Never force commit a file
#### Using git:
```sh
First pull from the repo so you are notified of any changes:
git pull origin Test
Next commit changes:
git commit -m "commit_message{just tell what you changed}"
Next add it to version control:
git add .
Next push the code to github
git push 
```
